# Code of Conduct

### Overview

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. 
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

### Open Participation

**Be open:** 
We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, 
and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.

### Inclusivity

**Be welcoming**: 
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, 
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, 
age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Respectful Communication

**Be respectful:** 
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. 
We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. 
It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

### Collaboration and Learning

**Be a teacher and a student:** 
Embrace the dual roles of teaching and learning within our community. Share your knowledge generously and be open to learning from others.

**Be collaborative:** 
Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. 
We strive for transparency within our open source community, 
and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.

### Conflict Resolution

**Always assume positive intent:** 
We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and act with empathy. 
Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.

### Guiding Principles

This code is not exhaustive or complete. 
It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. 
We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Thanks

This code of conduct is based on the work by [cashapp](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight), 
[Twitter (X)](https://github.com/twitter/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md), 
and our own [culture at ioki](https://ioki.com/en/about-ioki/culture/). 
We are thankful for their work.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior — or have any other concerns — please report it by emailing [opensource+coc@ioki.com](mailto:opensource+coc@ioki.com). 
All reports will be handled with discretion.

In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative from the Code of Conduct committee will contact you personally. 
The committee will then review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. 
If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the Code of Conduct committee may take any action they deem appropriate, 
up to and including a permanent ban from all of our community without warning.
